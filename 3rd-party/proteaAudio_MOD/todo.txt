- add method fadeSound(time) or even more flexible for fadeIn /fadeOut -> soundModulateVolume(factor, time)
- test alternative callback that is structured by sample, instead of by frame
- divide DeviceAudioSdl into basic and advanced
- move most mixer functionality into base class

- create high-level spatial audio methods
