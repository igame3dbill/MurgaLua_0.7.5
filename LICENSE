Hi,

This project is licensed under the full GPL Version 2

It contains files that have more permissive licenses,
but all my code is GPLv2 (See LICENSE-GPL).

This has caused problems, and I have been accused of
attaching additional "strings" ...

This is not the case, although I would like to avoid my
own code from being broken up and away from this project.

... As may have happened in the past.

One exception is the compiler, it has a different license
(COMPILER-LICENSE).

In general I am happy for people to use murgaLua and it's
code for whatever they want, as long as the licenses are
complied with when you re-distribute the source.

Cheers
JohnM
