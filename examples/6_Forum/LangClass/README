          MurgaLua FANN example:

           Language classifier.


Based on the paper on the FANN website (http://fann.sf.net/fann_en.pdf).

Description
-----------

These scripts classify a chunk of text into one of 3 languages based on the relative frequencies of the letters.
It takes some samples, trains a neural network on the letter frequencies represented in them, and chucks out the probabilities for the 3 considered languages.

Usage: 
-------
 * Unpack the zip containing this file (Probably done already)
 * Run murgaLua frequencies.lua to generate the relative letter frequencies in each sample file (saved to train.data).
 * Run murgaLua train.lua to train a new neural network (and save it to language_clas.net)
 * Run murgaLua classLang.lua samp1.txt to determine which language the sample text could be

Credits go to ME :) (only for the Lua-ification of the code)
Do whatever you want with it, but don't blame me if it eats your dog
