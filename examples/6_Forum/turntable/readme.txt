This is a test of an idea that just popped into my head.
I sometimes make GIF animations of 3D models showing a 360-degree
rotation of the model.  GIFs are limited, though, in that they can't be
paused or reversed.  A video format could do this, but it's much easier
just to do it the way it would be controlled in a 3D app, by dragging.

With this project I'm attempting to emulate 3D rotation by using a series of
images, which are changed according to the location of the mouse while dragging.

The script reads a directory of images, which can be changed by dragging the
mouse back a forth.  If your images are reversed (rotating right-to-left),
using the middle or right mouse button will change the images in reverse,
so it appears to drag the object in the proper direction.

One day I might try to take it a step further by rotating vertically,
but for now I'm okay with a simple turntable.  I'm thinking it could
also be taken into other directions, such as making clickable hotspots
or something like that, but that's also just a passing thought.
