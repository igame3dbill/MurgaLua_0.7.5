Here's a simple way, although probably inefficient, to create
a roll-over effect when interacting with a button.

This particular example uses a murgaLua timer loop to check
whether or not the cursor is over the button. I'm guessing
this is probably far from ideal, but so far I don't see any
way for a button itself to detect a roll-over.
