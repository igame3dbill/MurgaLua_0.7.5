A somewhat accurate emulation of the FLU Choice Group widget
(http://www.osc.edu/archive/FLU/)

The "page" table should ideally be a part of the flu_choice_group function,
but so far I haven't developed an easy way to do this. Incorporating every
necessary part of a group into a single function would go a long way toward
having the ability to easily create your own reusable composite widgets.
