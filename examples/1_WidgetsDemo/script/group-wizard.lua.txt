Fl_Wizard provides a group of panes just like Fl_Tabs, but without
the actual tabs. Navigation is done purely through programming,
which makes creation more complicated but allows for greater
flexibility. You can use the wizard with buttons as this example
does, or you could have the panes switch with some other action,
such as a key press, or when a timer runs out, or when the mouse
enters a certain coordinate, or when a group of objects are placed
in just the right positions. I'm sure there are many ways to use
this group that just wouldn't be appropriate with tabs.
