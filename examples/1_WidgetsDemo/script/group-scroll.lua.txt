Depending on the context of the scroll (whether or not
there are adjacent groups in the script) a scroll or a
pack may not require Fl_End() or widget:add(), although
it is generally a good idea for the sake of consistency
and to avoid possible future trouble. For example, this
script might work on its own without Fl_End(), but fails
if made the child of a parent window.
