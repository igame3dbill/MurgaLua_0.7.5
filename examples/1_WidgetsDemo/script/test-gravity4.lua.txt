Taking a new direction, this test is an attempt to reposition
the dots offscreen once they reach the cursor, as a way to
eliminate the apparent chaos of the previous two tests.

Somewhere along the way, the variance in gravitational pull
seems to have been lost or severely diminished, but it
becomes more cosmic. Groovy.

Since the dots are repositioned just offscreen, they end up
coming in from four distinct lines. Future tests will prove
to become more organic.
