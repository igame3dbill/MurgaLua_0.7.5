This is a simple experiment with dragging objects.
So far I'm not satisfied with it. It's very easy to drag a
given widget if that's the only widget you want dragged and
you don't mind grabbing it whenever you drag anywhere, but
I doubt that behaviour is ever the desired one.

Trying to determine if you are over the desired widget before
it moves is difficult, as the loop doesn't keep up with the
position of the cursor. When using Fl:event_inside() as a test
you must move the mouse slowly to keep from dropping the object.

This is just one of many things I have yet to learn =o)
