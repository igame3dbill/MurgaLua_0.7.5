The Fl_Counter widget is provided [in FLTK] for forms compatibility.
It controls a single floating point value.

FL_SIMPLE_COUNTER allows you to change the value by the smallest
step (0.1). FL_NORMAL_COUNTER adds a set of double arrows to control
a larger step, set with lstep(), which defaults to 1.0
