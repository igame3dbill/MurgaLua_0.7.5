An image sequence animation demo.

This was initially a test of pseudo-animation, which required the
user to press a repeat_button to force the looping of a sequence
of images. Shortly thereafter, John Murga took it and whipped out
this nice improvement that used his new timer in murgaLua 0.5

The timer's callback sets the box's image() to one of a series of
sequentially-named image files and then redraws the box.

The spinner changes the timer's wait time
