A basic test in interaction of widgets with mouse movement.

A number of boxes are placed at random locations on the
window, and a timer runs a loop. The loop checks for the location
of the mouse -- Fl:event_x() and Fl:event_y() -- and the location
of each box, and simply repositions the box closer to the mouse.

This results in the eventual converging of all boxes into a
single location, so then it gets boring.

The "fltk._FL_OVAL_BOX" check was done to support murgaLua 0.5.5
