A demo of different ways to draw your widget's label.

Some of the label types must be defined
before they can be used:
fltk.fl_define_FL_SHADOW_LABEL()
fltk.fl_define_FL_EMBOSSED_LABEL()
fltk.fl_define_FL_ENGRAVED_LABEL()

Note that this demo includes some labels that are blank
(other than just FL_NO_LABEL). This is frankly because I have
no idea how they are used =o)
