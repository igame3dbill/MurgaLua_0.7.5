Beta 4

This program demonstrates various features of MurgaLua, with
a focus on FLTK widgets (knobs, buttons, etc).

These are mostly very simple examples, and in no way show every
method of creating usable murgaLua scripts. 

The Lua manual was included to provide more detailed documentation.
The FLTK manual wasn't included, since it's provided with MurgaLua.

This program requires at least MurgaLua version 0.6.0
Some features will not work without versions newer than 0.6.0

If the ext_editor variable is set, the "external editor" button will
open the displayed code (as a temp file) into your specified editor.
After the editor closes, the temp file will be reloaded into the 
code display window. This is a temporary modification that can be
previewed with the "show demo" button, but only as long as you do
not select a new demo from the list. The code buffer must be saved
to a file if you want to keep your changes.

KEYBOARD CONTROL

Alt+I : Info tab
Alt+S : Source tab
Alt+D : Documentation tab
Alt+O : Options tab
Alt+L : Focus the file list
Up/Dn : Navigate the file list when it's focused
Enter : Show selected demo or toggle selected header
Alt+R : Show readme and source code for main script
Alt+M : Show Lua manual
Alt+C : Show code snippets
Alt+W : Show "What's New" page
Alt+E : Edit current code buffer in external editor
Alt+A : Save current code buffer
Alt+[1-4] : Jump to numbered file list header

All controls should work regardless of what tab has focus, except
those buttons that are visible only when the source tab is focused.
When tabs are selected via keyboard, the text field gets focus.
