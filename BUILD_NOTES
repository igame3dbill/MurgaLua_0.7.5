Build Notes
===========

MacOS
-----
MakeDepend is required for OpenSSL

You can create it by doing (as root) :

	vi /usr/bin/makedepend
	
	Typing this as the contents of the new file :
	
		gcc -M $*
		
	chmod +x /usr/bin/makedepend

OpenSolaris
-----------

This is the "problem OS" for murgaLua ...

The first thing you have to do is install GCC from their repositories, this is
easy enough at least :-)

Their version of make and awk are very problematic, so the next thing is to get
hold of GNU awk and gnu make :

	http://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/
	http://www.gnu.org/software/make/
	
These do build OK with GCC under Solaris, however, when you install them make
sure that you've replaced the system ones, doing the following will tell you :

	awk -W version
	make -version

Once this is done you can build with "tools/build/build-OpenSolaris.sh" ...
